HERE ARE THE PROCEDURES ENGAGED IN HOSTING A STATIC WEBSITE IN AN S3 BUCKET

1. I logged into my AWS account 
2. Next through the help of the AWS organisations I joined the project prepared by Frank
3. Then I created an S3 bucket
4. I also asigned all the neccessary permission needed for the the bucket to be visible
4. I unchecked "block public access" button to allow access and visibility from all public network
5. Next I copied the URL of my "index.html" file to a new tab.
6. And my static website was available like I have erlier stated.
